# typescript-project-starter

This is a boilerplate to start off your vanilla TypeScript project. It comes with Jest for unit tests, Flagpole for e2e tests, ESLint and Prettier with a good set of base rules. There are also some VS Code editor settings and ignore files.

This starter kit does not assume any specific frameworks. It is designed for a backend project with Node.
